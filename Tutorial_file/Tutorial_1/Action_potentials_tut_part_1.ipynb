    "## The Action Potential: The \"Fire\" Signal\n",
    "An action potential is the signal itself—a rapid, all-or-nothing electrical impulse that travels down the axon. When we say a neuron \"fires,\" we mean it's sending an action potential.\n",
    "\n",
    "The entire process is about the movement of charged particles (ions), mainly sodium (Na+) and potassium (K+), across the neuron's membrane.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. The Resting State (Ready)\n",
    "When a neuron is \"at rest\" and waiting for a signal, it has a stable electrical charge of about -70 millivolts (mV). This is called the resting potential.\n",
    "\n",
    "This negative charge is maintained because there are more positive sodium ions outside the cell and more positive potassium ions inside the cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sodium-potassium pump actively works to keep it this way, like a bouncer keeping the crowds separated.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. The Trigger (Threshold)\n",
    "The neuron receives signals from its dendrites. If these signals are strong enough to push the cell's charge from -70mV up to a trigger point called the threshold (around -55mV), the action potential begins. It's \"all-or-nothing\"—if it doesn't hit the threshold, it doesn't fire. If it does, it fires completely.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Depolarization (Rising Action)\n",
    "Once the -55mV threshold is hit, voltage-gated sodium (Na+) channels fly open.\n",
    "\n",
    "Positive sodium ions (Na+) rush into the cell, causing the inside to become rapidly positive (up to +30mV). This massive change in charge is the action potential spike.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Repolarization (Falling Action)\n",
    "At the peak, the sodium (Na+) channels close.\n",
    "\n",
    "Slower voltage-gated potassium (K+) channels open.\n",
    "\n",
    "Positive potassium (K+) ions rush out of the cell, making the inside negative again and bringing the charge back down.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Hyperpolarization (Overshoot)\n",
    "The potassium channels are a bit slow to close, so the charge briefly dips even more negative than the resting potential. This \"downtime\" is called the refractory period, which ensures the signal can only travel in one direction (down the axon).\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the sodium-potassium pump restores everything to its resting state, ready to fire again. This entire electrical signal then travels down the axon to the axon terminals, where it triggers the release of neurotransmitters to the next neuron."
