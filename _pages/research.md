    <i>Impact of Slow Wave Abnormalities and Impaired Coordination of Pyloric Closure and Antral Contraction on Gastric Emptying: A Compartmental Modeling Study.</i> 
    Submitted to: <b>Annals of Biomedical Engineering (BMES)</b>, 2025. <br>
    <ul>
        <li>Developed a computationally efficient gastric compartmental model to simulate diseased stomach function by altering antral–pyloric coordination and slow wave dynamics.</li>
        <li>Incorporated enhanced flow coupling and regional slow wave variability (bradygastria, tachygastria, and quiescent activity) to evaluate motility, gastric emptying, and mixing efficiency under healthy and impaired conditions.</li>
        <li>Demonstrated that abnormal slow wave patterns delay gastric emptying, induce retrograde transpyloric flow, and reduce mixing efficiency—providing a mechanistic and fast-executing platform for model-based closed-loop neurostimulation therapy design.</li>
