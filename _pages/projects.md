Using image-processing techniques—including motion correction, segmentation, Otsu thresholding, and spatiotemporal imaging—to extract quantitative data, followed by applying data-science methods such as logistic regression, LDA, QDA, and KNN to evaluate which data-science approach best predicts the effects of VNS on gastric motility.

Extending the existing Hodgkin–Huxley model to represent the afferent vagal nerve in rats, and using cable theory to model action potential propagation along the nerve.

A comparative study of carbon nanotube (CNT) shear deformation—across chirality, temperature, strain rates, and double-walled structures—showed that CNTs fracture only under very high stress, with double-walled CNTs displaying greater mechanical strength. All simulations used the AIREBO potential, which models covalent bonding and long-range van der Waals interactions.

[Modeling of a reactor for Methanol Synthesis using Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst](/Project_document/Presentation_project_methanol.pdf).

Methanol synthesis—an exothermic hydrogenation of CO2 over a Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst—proceeds primarily through two rate-determining steps: CO2 dissociative adsorption and formate hydrogenation, with formate as the dominant intermediate. A 1D pseudo-homogeneous reactor model using the Vanden Bussche–Froment kinetics best matches industrial data (error <1%) and remains the most accurate for commercial multi-tubular reactor conditions.
