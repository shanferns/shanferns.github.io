Using image-processing techniques—including motion correction, segmentation, Otsu thresholding, and spatiotemporal imaging—to extract quantitative data, followed by applying data-science methods such as logistic regression, LDA, QDA, and KNN to evaluate which approach best captures the effects of VNS on gastric motility.
